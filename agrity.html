                            <p class="lead sup">
								Joining a startup can be daunting, especially when you’re unfamiliar with the market. 
								Agrity was a team of three founders, and I was brought on to help in bringing their 
								ideas in the AgTech space to life using design. 
                            </p>
							<p class="lead sup">
								First, it was essential for me to understand the specialty agriculture space 
								and how it currently functions. We established that there were <strong>inefficiencies, a lack of 
								transparency, and inaccurate information disrupting the moving of a commodity from a grower 
								to a buyer</strong>. This was due to the numerous middlemen that strike deals on gut feeling alone 
								without any use of data in this “pen and paper” industry. Deals are made by phone and 
								offline, which promotes these inconsistencies and lacks in any data driven decisions. In 
								short, the <strong>specialty Agriculture industry was stuck in an archaic age</strong> and <strong>needed a 
								revamping of digital tools</strong> to enhance that process.
							</p>
							<p class="lead sup">
								As the sole designer, my next step was to understand the target user. My cofounders tried 
								to paint a picture for me of our 55 year old non tech-savvy male user, even having me sit 
								in on cold calls. But it wasn't giving me the best idea of how they currently conduct 
								business. <strong>In order to design for the ideal user, I needed to meet the ideal user</strong>. I 
								accompanied the cofounders on a 3 hour drive to the Central Valley to meet with a few almond 
								handlers and understand their pain points. I asked them about the current technology that 
								they use, their everyday schedules, and any other feedback they would have on a possible 
								tech solution to their everyday problem. We concluded that not only does our solution need 
								to be extremely simple and easy to use, certain "wow factors" needed to be included in our 
								design interactions in order for the user to abandon handwritten scribbles and ease into a 
								digital platform.

								By focusing on the user's pain points, <strong>we established an MVP for handlers</strong> 
								to create bids, send them out to growers via text, and track responses. The certain "wow 
								factors" were the ability to send the same bid out to several growers with the click of a 
								button, and seeing responses automatically updated and stored for future records. </p>
							<p class="lead sup">	
								I then proceeded to sketch user flows, interactions, and a basic interface to accomplish 
								these tasks. The process began with whiteboarding, moved to pencil sketches, and quickly made 
								its way to low fidelity mock ups.</p>

								another trip to the Central Valley. In order to efficiently test our mockups, <strong>we used a 
								Wizard of Oz technique</strong>. The "wow factors" that had not yet been implemented were simply 
								replaced by manual texts when a button was clicked or hardcoded messages to show updated 
								responses. </p>

								The Wizard of Oz technique was useful in ensuring that I was designing for the user, with

								With a large project and a small team (2 engineers, and 4 undergrad CS interns), 
								we broke down the development into stages. First, it was a <strong>necessity that our 
								digital tool is web specific</strong>. We needed to build a web app for Handlers to send 
								bids to Growers and for Traders to send bids to Handlers. These were ideally 2 
								separate projects and were treated as such. We began with building the Handler 
								side, then transitioning to building the Trader side. The estimated time 
								developing and iterating on both is 10 weeks.</p>
							<p class="lead sup">
								Given my Frontend experience, we decided to build the web app using Angular2. 
								In order to efficiently complete this project, we built in 2 week sprints, using post-its
								for ticket tracking (shoutout Silicon Valley). Each day, Larsen Jensen and Jack McCarthy 
								(two of the founders) would present the web app to numerous customers and gather 
								feedback for further iterations.</p>
							<p class="lead sup">
								After many iterations and post-its taken off the walls, Version 1 of our product 
								went live in September of 2016.</p>

								<p class="lead sup">
									Though we were able to achieve verbal confirmations from 20% of the 
									specialty agriculture almond industry to use our web app, our 
									product is unfortunately not in use today. We concluded that even 
									though we built a minimum viable product directed towards our users, 
									and gauged their interest in preliminary meetings, it was not enough 
									for non tech-savvy users to adopt a digital product. As they say, 
									you can’t teach an old dog new tricks. 
								</p>
								<p class="lead sup">
									Nevertheless, this was an incredible learning experience for myself 
									and the rest of team Agrity. We were able to build a product from the 
									ground up, from analysis to definition to ideation to idea selection 
									to implementation to evaluation. I was able to own a full design 
									process and have a heavy hand in the development stage as well. So 
									despite the lack of success, it was worthwhile to be a part of the process.
